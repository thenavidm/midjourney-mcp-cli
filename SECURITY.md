# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report privately through GitHub:
[open a security advisory](https://github.com/thenavidm/midjourney-mcp-cli/security/advisories/new).

Please do not open a public issue for a vulnerability.

## What this server can reach

It holds no credential. The Midjourney session lives in a Chrome profile at
`~/.midjourney-mcp/chrome-profile`, and this process only tells that browser to
make requests. It never reads a cookie, stores a token, or sees a password.

That browser profile is the sensitive thing on disk. Anyone who can read it can
act as the signed-in Midjourney account, exactly as with any browser profile.

The DevTools port it drives listens on loopback only. Do not expose it: anything
that can reach that port can drive the browser, and therefore the account.

## Running it over HTTP

`--http` refuses to listen on anything but loopback without
`MIDJOURNEY_HTTP_TOKEN`, because the server acts as a signed-in account and can
spend money from a paid plan. It also refuses a request from a page on another
site unless `MIDJOURNEY_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` lists that site, because a browser
can send one to a server on localhost.

## Limiting what an agent can do

Anything that spends GPU time waits for approval: over MCP a person approves
each call where the client can ask, in Claude Code's own prompt or an approval
form; elsewhere the model must pass `confirm: true`, and `MIDJOURNEY_CONFIRM=model`
allows that everywhere. `MIDJOURNEY_READ_ONLY=1` removes every tool that is not a
read, so a model cannot call one it cannot see. `MIDJOURNEY_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=0`
keeps reads and downloads while blocking anything that spends.
`MIDJOURNEY_AUDIT_LOG=<path>` records every attempted change, allowed and blocked
alike, with who approved it.

## Supported versions

The latest published version is the supported one.
